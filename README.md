# myreads
Book tracking web app inspired by GoodReads. Built using the Python Flask framework and the Google Books API for the back-end,
as well as Bootstrap5/SCSS for the front-end.

This project was really a step-up from my previous project (barebones-inventory), also made in Python using Flask.
On this project I used an API for the very first time, this definitely had its challenges, in this particular 
project I really struggled at first due to the fact that not all responses from the Google Books API are formatted the same way.
This was also my first time using npm and SCSS to override Bootstrap5 which really put into perspective how frameworks
can really speed up development time tremendously by automating menial tasks. Prior to this project I had no idea 
that frameworks could be this powerful when not used as a crutch, but rather as a way to allow someone to really
focus on the sections of the project at hand that truly require the most expertise (instead of having to rewrite
reptitive code present in nearly all projects as is common in vanilla CSS).

The objective of this project was to swim into the deep end for the first time, to build something
that isn't solely for practice but that could realistically be used by someone. I can confidently
state that, in my opinion, this objective was fullfilled.
